- Observe plan and consider:
	- Repeat until
	- If path ahead do
	- If path ahead do else

- Plan -> Translator -k-> Generalised Plan
- HTN?
	- Compund tasks - autogenerated:
		- Move-forward-turn-left-ahead
			-Move-forward
			-Turn-left (something like this
	- Action management - only K lines in the plan allowed

- Draw graphs showing as tile count increases - the time taken to compute plans are exponential (something on these lines)
- Use probabilistic actions

- STRIPS-PLANNING is PSPACE-Complete (Reducible from SAT)

- Use Deep Neural Networks
