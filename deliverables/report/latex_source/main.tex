\chapter*{Abstract}
Path finding, a fundamental aspect of gaming and Artificial Intelligence (AI), has garnered significant attention in recent years. This report delves into the complexities of path finding, exploring its applications in gaming. While traditional AI planning has focused on solvable instances, the emergence of generalized planning presents new opportunities and challenges. This project aims to explore the implications of extracting more general solutions for \textit{complex path finding} problems. Motivated by the scarcity of tools leveraging generalized planning in gaming, this project seeks to develop a suite of complex path finding \textit{problem generators}. These problems generated by these generators are designed to push the boundaries of existing planners, fostering an environment for academic exploration and advancement. Targeted towards students and enthusiasts in Knowledge-Based AI, this report provides insights into both classical and generalized planning methodologies. The objectives of this project include exploring state-of-the-art planners, modeling path finding problems, creating intuitive visualizations, analysing planner performance, and comparing classical versus generalized plans. Through these objectives, the project aims to furnish an easy-to-use tool with optimized planning examples, facilitating learning and development in the domain of AI.
